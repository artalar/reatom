## Setup batching for old React

For React 16 and 17 you need to setup batching by yourself in the root fo your app

For `react-dom`

```js
import { unstable_batchedUpdates } from 'react-dom'
import { setupBatch } from '@reatom/react-v1'

setupBatch(unstable_batchedUpdates)``
```

For `react-native`

```js
import { unstable_batchedUpdates } from 'react-native'
import { setupBatch } from '@reatom/react-v1'

setupBatch(unstable_batchedUpdates)``
```
