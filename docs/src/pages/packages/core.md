## Features

- 🐣 **simple abstraction** and friendly DX: minimum boilerplate and tiny API
- ⚡ **performance**: performant updates for partial state changes
- 🧯 **reliable**: [atomicity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)>) guaranties
- ❗️ **static typed**: best type inferences
- 🗜 **small size**: [2 KB](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@reatom/core) gzipped
- 📦 **modular**: reusable instances (SSR)
- 🍴 **lazy**: solution for code splitting out of the box
- 🔌 **framework-agnostic**: independent and self-sufficient
- 🧪 **testing**: simple mocking
- 🛠 **debugging**: immutable data and built-in debugger
- 👴 **IE11 support**: [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/?search=weakmap)
- synchronous [glitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming#Glitches) free
- simple integration with other libraries (Observable, redux ecosystem, etc)
- awkward to write bad code
- easy to write good code

Reatom is a mix of all best from MobX and Redux. It processes immutable data by separated atoms and use single global store, which make dataflow predictable, but granular and efficient.
