This is the binding for the [Solid](https://solidjs.com) view framework. The reason to use these bindings is the Reatom ecosystem. We have a lot of packages and helpers to handle basic UI logic, including network caching, data persistence, and complex flow description.

To use it, you need to install `@reatom/core` or `@reatom/framework` and `solid-js`.

> Read [the core docs](https://www.reatom.dev/core) first for production usage.

## Usage

Try it now: https://stackblitz.com/edit/reatomnpm-solid-js?file=src%2FApp.tsx

### Setup reatomContext

The first time, you need to add the Reatom provider to the root of your application.

```tsx
import { createCtx, connectLogger } from '@reatom/framework'
import { reatomContext } from '@reatom/npm-solid-js'

const ctx = createCtx()
connectLogger(ctx)

render(
  () => (
    <reatomContext.Provider value={ctx}>
      <App />
    </reatomContext.Provider>
  ),
  document.getElementById('root')!,
)
```

### useAtom hook

Now you will be able to use Reatom hooks.

```tsx
import { atom } from '@reatom/framework'
import { useAtom } from '@reatom/npm-solid-js'

const countAtom = atom(0, 'countAtom')

const App: Component = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useAtom(countAtom)

  return (
    <div>
      Count value is
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>{count()}</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<!-- ## Inline atoms

Of course, you could create atoms inside a component's body to scope your state. Alternatively, you could pass the initial state to `useAtom` to create a new atom and subscribe to it. It is useful to use atoms instead of native Solid signals if you want better logging or if you want your logic to be coupled with Reatom.

> Reatom allows you track the reason of each update and async effect: https://www.reatom.dev/guides/debug/

```tsx
import { useAtom } from '@reatom/npm-solid-js'

const CountingComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useAtom(0)

  return (
    <div>
      Count value is
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>{count()}</button>
    </div>
  )
}
``` -->

### useCtx hook

If you need to get the `ctx` from the context, you could use the shortcut hook `useCtx`. With `ctx` in the component body, you can manipulate subscriptions more flexibly with Solid's `onMount`, `onCleanup`, and so on.

## Examples

### Dynamic atom creation

This example shoes how to use [atomization](https://www.reatom.dev/recipes/atomization) to improve editable fields performance, persists it to localStorage.
