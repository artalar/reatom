This package provides a vast set of utilities for describing asynchronous logic with Reatom.

> included in [@reatom/framework](https://www.reatom.dev/package/framework)

Primitives provided by this package are asynchronous counterparts of corresponding `@reatom/core` primitives:

|  type |                   derivation                   |                      mutation                      |
| ----: | :--------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------: |
|  sync | [`atom`](https://reatom.dev/package/core#atom) | [`action`](https://reatom.dev/package/core#action) |
| async |       [reatomResource](#reatomresource)        |            [reatomAsync](#reatomasync)             |

Both are designed to be extended with a handful of built-in operators:

- [`withDataAtom`](#withdataatom): stores the latest value the promise resolved with
- [`withErrorAtom`](#witherroratom): stores the latest value the promise rejected with
- [`withStatusesAtom`](#withstatusesatom): stores boolean fields indicating loading statuses
- [`withCache`](#withcache): provides advanced caching strategies
- [`withAbort`](#withabort): manages concurrent calls
- [`withRetry`](#withretry): manages retries

Including `reatomAsync` adds only [1.2KB](https://bundlejs.com/?q=%40reatom%2Fasync&treeshake=%5B%7B+reatomAsync+%7D%5D) to your bundle size and including all features adds [2.6KB](https://bundlejs.com/?q=%40reatom%2Fasync).

## `reatomAsync`

The first parameter of `reatomAsync` is an asynchronous function (any function that returns a `Promise`) that does desired side effects. It accepts `ctx` and an optional list of additional parameters. The returned value of `reatomAsync` is an `AsyncAction` which is identical to sync `Action`, but has several extra fields we will cover later.

```ts
const doSomething = reatomAsync((ctx, param) => {
  const result = await ctx.schedule(() => SomeApi.doSomethingAsync({ param }))
  return result.body
})

doSomething(ctx, 777) //=> Promise
```

Passed `ctx` has `controller` property which is an instance of [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) whose `signal` may be passed to abortable APIs like `fetch`. If [`withAbort`](#withabort) is used, `controller` of a `Ctx` scoped to action call and all its nested contexts are `abort`-ed by Reatom whenever a subsequent call is made. This feature is exceptionally useful when implementing models that fetch data every time an often-changed atom is updated, like search input suggestions.

Because `@reatom/async` is agnostic of the way you fetch data, may use any library or API to make requests, like `fetch` or [`redaxios`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redaxios).

For simple cases of turning plain async function to `AsyncAction`-s, you can use [`reatomAsync.from`](#reatomasyncfrom).

### Hooks

`AsyncAction` has several action fields you can subscribe to with `onCall`. They are called automatically when a promise returned by user code is settled:

- `onFulfill`: called when promise is resolved, like `Promise.then`
- `onReject`: called when promise is rejected, like `Promise..catch`
- `onSettle`: called when promise is either resolved or rejected, like `Promise..finally`

Example:

```ts
const reatomDoSomething = reatomAsync(async ctx => {
  // ...
}, 'reatomDoSomething')

let status: 'n/a' | 'pending' | 'resolved' | 'rejected' = 'n/a'

reatomDoSomething.onCall((ctx) => {
  status = 'pending'
})

reatomDoSomething.onSettle.onCall((ctx) => {
  // ...
})

reatomDoSomething.onFulfill.onCall((ctx) => {
  status = 'resolved'
})

reatomDoSomething.onReject.onCall((ctx) => {
  status = 'rejected'
})
```

### Prologue to examples

In examples below, the following helper will be used for making HTTP requests:

```ts
async function request<T>(...args: Parameters<typeof fetch>): Promise<T> {
  const response = await fetch(...args)
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(response.statusText)
  return await response.json()
}
```

### Minimal example

```ts
import { reatomAsync } from '@reatom/async'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx, page: number) =>
    request(`/api/list?page=${page}`, { signal: ctx.controller.signal }),
  'fetchList',
)
```

### Advanced example

Now we are going to solve a more complex task: remember the last fetched list state and error if the request failed, cancel previous requests when making subsequent ones and add an action to mutate the list. The next snippet assumes that you are familiar with [`withAssign`](https://reatom.dev/package/primitives#withassign) and [`action..onCall`](https://reatom.dev/package/core#actiononcall-api).

```ts
import { reatomAsync } from '@reatom/async'
import { atom } from '@reatom/core'
import { withAssign } from '@reatom/primitives'

const ABORT = Symbol('ABORT')
interface Element {
  id: string
  /* ... */
}

export const fetchList = reatomAsync((ctx, page: number) => {
  ctx.get(fetchList.abortControllerAtom).abort(ABORT)
  fetchList.abortControllerAtom(ctx, ctx.controller)

  return request<Array<Element>>(`/api/list?page=${page}`, {
    signal: ctx.controller,
  })
}, 'fetchList').pipe(
  withAssign((target, name) => ({
    abortControllerAtom: atom(
      new AbortController(),
      `${name}.abortControllerAtom`,
    ),
    dataAtom: atom([] as Element[], `${name}.dataAtom`),
    errorAtom: atom(null as Error | null, `${name}.errorAtom`),
    isLoadingAtom: atom(
      (ctx) => ctx.spy(fetchList.pendingAtom) > 0,
      `${name}.isLoadingAtom`,
    ),
  })),
)
fetchList.onFulfill.onCall((ctx, state) => {
  fetchList.dataAtom(ctx, state)
  fetchList.errorAtom(ctx, null)
})
fetchList.onReject.onCall((ctx, reason) => {
  if (reason === ABORT) return
  const error = thing instanceof Error ? thing : new Error(String(thing))
  fetchList.errorAtom(ctx, error)
})

export const updateElement = reatomAsync(
  (ctx, id: string, slice: Partial<Element>) => {
    const { signal } = ctx.controller
    const data = JSON.stringify(slice)
    return request(`/api/list/${id}`, { method: 'POST', data, signal })
  },
  'updateElement',
)
updateElement.onFulfill.onCall((ctx) => fetchList(ctx, 1))
```

### Idiomatic advanced example

The snipper above is an example of well-designed reactive asynchronous model. Thanks to Reatom, it is in many ways superior to what you would write with vanilla JS: it is reactive, has no module-scoped state and is easy to debug as well as to test. However, there is many boilerplate that makes it difficult to both read and edit it. Here operators come in:

```ts
import {
  reatomAsync,
  withAbort,
  withDataAtom,
  withErrorAtom,
  withStatusesAtom,
} from '@reatom/framework'

type Element = {
  id: string
  /* ... */
}

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx, page: number) =>
    request<Array<Element>>(`/api/list?page=${page}`, {
      signal: ctx.controller.signal,
    }),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withDataAtom([]), withErrorAtom(), withAbort(), withStatusesAtom())

export const updateElement = reatomAsync(
  (ctx, id: string, slice: Partial<Element>) => {
    const { signal } = ctx.controller
    const data = JSON.stringify(slice)
    return request(`/api/list/${id}`, { method: 'POST', data, signal })
  },
  'updateElement',
)
updateElement.onFulfill.onCall((ctx) => fetchList(ctx, 1))
```

Using operators, we reduced the code dramatically without sacrificing any functionality:

- abort logic is delegated to `withAbort`
- `fetchList.dataAtom` is provided by `withDataAtom`
- `fetchList.errorAtom` is provided by `withDataAtom`
- `fetchList.isLoadingAtom` is now `isPending` field of `statusesAtom` provided by `withStatusesAtom`

## `reatomAsync.from`

A helper that wraps a function with `reatomAsync` by creating an async action that calls the passed function, forwarding all arguments but `ctx`:

```ts
async function doSomething(i: number) {
  return i + 1
}

const reatomDoSomething = reatomAsync.from(doSomething)

await reatomDoSomething(ctx, 5) //=> 6
```

It also attempts to infer action name from function name automatically, though you can override it explicitly using the second parameter:

```ts
reatomDoSomething.__reatom.name // doSomething
```

## withDataAtom

This is the most dump and useful operator to manage data from a backend. Adds property `dataAtom` which updates by `onFulfill` or manually. It is like a tiny cache level, but mostly for client purposes. `reset` action included already.

Let's say we have a feature, which should be loaded from the backend, changed by a user and saved back to the backend. We could use `withDataAtom` to store the actual state in the atom.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withDataAtom } from '@reatom/async'

type Feature = {
  /*...*/
}

export const fetchFeature = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request<Feature>('/api/feature', ctx.controller),
  'fetchFeature',
).pipe(withDataAtom(null))
// use subscription to `fetchFeature.dataAtom` to get the actual data

// mutate data manually in the feature form
export const changeFeature = action(
  (ctx, property: keyof Feature, value: any) => {
    fetchUser.dataAtom(ctx, (user) => ({ ...user, [property]: value }))
  },
  'changeFeature',
)

// save new feature data to backend on form submit
export const syncFeature = reatomAsync((ctx) => {
  const { signal } = ctx.controller
  const body = JSON.stringify(ctx.get(fetchFeature.dataAtom))
  return request('/api/feature', { method: 'POST', body, signal })
}, 'syncFeature')
```

Here we can see an important pattern for handling backend data. Many web interfaces exist solely for displaying backend DTOs and allowing users to modify them. This data is not shared between different pages of the application, so it is safe to mutate the state obtained from the backend.

Using the same state for both the backend payload and the local form is a more predictable and cleaner approach, as they have the same static type and it is impossible to encounter glitches during data synchronization. Additionally, it requires less code!

However, if you need to separate or share your backend data between different pages and want to optimize it, it is better to use the [withCache](#withcache) feature.

### Fetch data on demand

Here how you can fetch data declaratively and lazy only when needed. This is a super simple and useful combine of `async` and `hooks` packages, which shows the power of Reatom.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withDataAtom } from '@reatom/async'
import { onConnect } from '@reatom/hooks'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withDataAtom([]))
onConnect(fetchList.dataAtom, fetchList)
```

What this code do? When you connect to `fetchList.dataAtom` it will automatically call `fetchList` action. Connection could appear in any place of your application, by `ctx.subscribe(fetchList.dataAtom, cb)` or by using `useAtom(fetchList.dataAtom)` hook from [@reatom/npm-react](https://www.reatom.dev/package/npm-react). Even by a different atom.

```ts
export const filteredListAtom = atom(
  (ctx) => ctx.spy(fetchList.dataAtom).filter((item) => item.active),
  'filteredListAtom',
)
```

When `filteredListAtom` will be connected, `fetchList` will be called automatically too! And when `fetchList` will be fulfilled, `filteredListAtom` will be updated. All things just works together as expected.

### Adding data you've fetched to data you've fetched before

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withDataAtom } from '@reatom/async'

const PAGE_SIZE = 10

export const fetchFeed = reatomAsync(async (ctx, page: number) => {
  const data = await request(
    `api/feed?page=${page}&limit?${page}`,
    ctx.controller,
  )
  return { data, page }
}, 'fetchFeed').pipe(
  withDataAtom([], (ctx, { data, page }, state) => {
    const newState = [...state]
    newState.splice((page - 1) * PAGE_SIZE, PAGE_SIZE, ...data)
    return newState
  }),
)
```

### Optimistic update

You could describe optimistic async logic easily with `onEffect` handler, which allow you to read passed parameters by third argument.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withDataAtom } from '@reatom/async'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withDataAtom([]))

export const updateList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx, newList) => {
    const { signal } = ctx.controller
    const data = JSON.stringify(newList)
    return request('/api/list', { method: 'POST', data, signal })
  },
  {
    name: 'updateList',
    onEffect(ctx, params, promise) {
      const [newList] = params
      const newList = fetchList.dataAtom(ctx, newList)
    },
  },
)
```

For more details of optimistic update check the story tests in [the sources](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/blob/v3/packages/async/src/index.story.test.ts) or in [the end of this doc](https://www.reatom.dev/package/async#story-test).

### Custom dataAtom

If you need to persist effect result to local state and want to use some additional atom, you could describe that logic just by using `fetchList.onFulfill.onCall(listAtom)`.

```ts
import { reatomArray } from '@reatom/primitives'
import { reatomAsync } from '@reatom/async'

export type Element = {
  id: string
  // ...
}

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request<Array<Element>>('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
)
export const listAtom = reatomArray(new Array<Element>(), 'listAtom')
fetchList.onFulfill.onCall(listAtom)
```

Here the interface of `onFulfill` update hook and `listAtom` update is the same and because of that we could pass `listAtom` just by a reference. If you have a different type of the cache atom, you could map payload just by a function.

```ts
import { reatomMap } from '@reatom/primitives'
// ....
export const mapAtom = reatomMap(new Map<string, Element>(), 'mapAtom')
fetchList.onFulfill.onCall((ctx, payload) =>
  mapAtom(ctx, new Map(payload.map((el) => [el.id, el]))),
)
```

## withErrorAtom

Adds `errorAtom`, similar to `dataAtom`, which updates by `onReject` and clears by `onFulfill` by default. You could add an optional mapper function by the first parameter to ensure your error type. By the second optional object parameter you could set `resetTrigger` (`null | 'onEffect' | 'onFulfill'`) or `initState`. The last one `undefined` by default and it also used in reset logic.

You could update the error atom manually as a usual atom: `fetchList.errorAtom(ctx, someError)`. You could reset the state by yourself by additional `reset` action: `fetchList.errorAtom.reset(ctx)`

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withErrorAtom } from '@reatom/async'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(
  withErrorAtom(
    // optional mapper
    (ctx, error) =>
      error instanceof Response
        ? error.status
        : error?.message || 'unknown error',
  ),
)
```

## withStatusesAtom

Adds property `statusesAtom` with additional statuses, which updates by the effect calling, `onFulfill` and `onReject`. The state is a record with following boolean properties: `isPending`, `isFulfilled`, `isRejected`, `isSettled`, `isFirstPending`, `isEverPending`, `isEverSettled`.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withStatusesAtom } from '@reatom/async'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withStatusesAtom())

// ...

const initStatuses = ctx.get(fetchList.statusesAtom)

initStatuses.isPending // false
initStatuses.isFulfilled // false
initStatuses.isRejected // false
initStatuses.isSettled // false

initStatuses.isFirstPending // false
initStatuses.isEverPending // false
initStatuses.isEverSettled // false
```

> `!isEverPending` is like _init_ state, `isEverSettled` is like _loaded_ state, `isFirstPending` is perfect match for "stale while revalidate" pattern.

`statusesAtom` has an additional `reset` action that you can use to clear all statuses. Any pending promises will be ignored in this case. For example:

```ts
onDisconnect(fetchList.dataAtom, (ctx) => {
  fetchList.dataAtom.reset(ctx)
  fetchList.statusesAtom.reset(ctx)
})
```

You could import special types of statuses of each effect state and use it for typesafe conditional logic.

```ts
export type AsyncStatusesPending =
  | AsyncStatusesFirstPending
  | AsyncStatusesAnotherPending

export type AsyncStatuses =
  | AsyncStatusesNeverPending
  | AsyncStatusesPending
  | AsyncStatusesFulfilled
  | AsyncStatusesRejected
```

## withCache

This is the most famous feature of any resource management. You are not required to use `withDataAtom`, the cache worked for effect results, but if `dataAtom` exists - it will worked as well and you could react on data changes immediately.

This operator adds `cacheAtom` property which is `MapAtom` from [@reatom/primitives](https://www.reatom.dev/package/primitives#reatommap) and contains the cache of effect results. Do not change it manually! But you could use `reset` action to clear the cache. Also `cacheAtom` contains `invalidate` action which clears all existed cache and call new fetch with the last payload.

`withCache` adds `swrPendingAtom` which is relative to `swr` option (see above).

If the async action will called with the same params during existing fetching - the same promise will returned.

You could rule the cache behavior by set of optional parameters.

- **length** - maximum amount of cache records. Default is `5`.
- **staleTime** - the amount of milliseconds after which a cache record will cleanup. Default is `5 * 60 * 1000`ms which is 5 minutes.
- **paramsLength** - the number of excepted parameters, which will used as a cache key. Default is "all".
- **isEqual** - check the equality of a cache record and passed params to find the cache. Default is `isDeepEqual` from [@reatom/utils](https://www.reatom.dev/package/utils).
- **paramsToKey** - convert params to a string as a key of the cache map. Not used by default, equality check (`isEqual`) is used instead. This option is useful if you have a complex object as a params which equality check is too expensive, or you was set large `length` option and want to speed up the cache search.
  > You could import and use [toStringKey](https://www.reatom.dev/package/utils#tostringkey) function from the utils package for this purposes.
- **swr** - enable [stale while revalidate](https://web.dev/stale-while-revalidate/) pattern. Default is `true`. It allow to return the cached data immediately (if exist) and run extra fetch for the fresh data on the background. Success SWR fetch will call `onFulfill` to force new data for `dataAtom`, you could change this behavior by `swr: { shouldFulfill: false }`, in this case the SWR logic is just a background silent synchronization to speedup a next fetch. There also two additional options, which is `false` by default: `shouldReject` and `shouldPending`.
  `withCache` adds `swrPendingAtom` to passed async
- **withPersist** - `WithPersist` instance from one of the adapter of [@reatom/persist](https://www.reatom.dev/package/persist). It will used with predefined optimal parameters for internal Map (de)serialization and so on.
- **ignoreAbort** - define if the effect should be prevented from abort. The outer abort strategy is not affected, which means that all hooks and returned promise will behave the same. But the effect execution could be continued even if abort appears, to save the result in the cache. Default is `true`.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withDataAtom, withCache } from '@reatom/async'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withDataAtom(), withCache())

// fetch data
await fetchList(ctx, { query: 'foo', page: 1 }) // call the effect
const firstResult = ctx.get(fetchList.dataAtom)

// fetch another data
await fetchList(ctx, { query: 'bar', page: 2 })

// request data with the equal parameters
fetchList(ctx, { page: 1, query: 'foo' })
// the cache comes to `onFulfill` and `dataAtom` as well synchronously
isEqual(firstResult, ctx.get(fetchList.dataAtom)) // true
```

### Invalidate cache

You could invalidate the cache by `reset` action on `cacheAtom`. It will clear the whole cache records of the async action.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withCache, withDataAtom } from '@reatom/async'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withCache(), withDataAtom())

export const updateList = reatomAction(() => {
  /*  */
}, 'updateList')
updateList.onFulfill.onCall(fetchList.cacheAtom.reset)
```

You could use `withRetry` to retry the effect after cache invalidation or use built-in action for that. `cacheAtom.invalidate` will clear the cache and call the effect immediately with the last params.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withCache, withDataAtom } from '@reatom/async'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withCache(), withDataAtom())

export const updateList = reatomAction(() => {
  /*  */
}, 'updateList')
updateList.onFulfill.onCall(fetchList.cacheAtom.invalidate)

export const listLoadingAtom = atom(
  (ctx) => ctx.spy(fetchList.pendingAtom) + ctx.spy(updateList.pendingAtom) > 0,
)
```

Use `listLoadingAtom` to show a loader in a UI during the whole process of data updating and invalidation.

### Sync cache

You could persist the cache for a chosen time and sync it across a tabs by `withLocalStorage` from [@reatom/persist-web-storage](https://www.reatom.dev/package/persist-web-storage). You could use `withSessionStorage` if you need only synchronization.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withCache } from '@reatom/async'
import { withLocalStorage } from '@reatom/persist-web-storage'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withCache({ withPersist: withLocalStorage }))
```

`withCache` applies `withPersist` to `cacheAtom` with options for optimal serialization. You could redefine the options by an inline decorator function. It is recommended to set the key explicitly, by default the async action name used.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withCache } from '@reatom/async'
import { withLocalStorage } from '@reatom/persist-web-storage'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(
  withCache({
    withPersist: (options) =>
      withLocalStorage({ ...options, key: 'LIST_CACHE' }),
  }),
)
```

If you want to use persisted cache as an init state of `dataAtom` - just put `withCache` **after** `withDataAtom`!

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withDataAtom, withCache } from '@reatom/async'
import { withLocalStorage } from '@reatom/persist-web-storage'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withDataAtom([]), withCache({ withPersist }))
```

## withRetry

Adds `retry` action and `paramsAtom` to store last params of the effect call.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withCache, withDataAtom, withRetry } from '@reatom/async'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withCache(), withDataAtom(), withRetry())

export const updateList = reatomAction(() => {
  /*  */
}, 'updateList')
updateList.onFulfill.onCall(fetchList.cacheAtom.reset)
updateList.onFulfill.onCall(retry)
```

If you will try to call `retry` before first effect call, it will throw an error. To avoid this you could specify `fallbackParams` option.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withRetry } from '@reatom/async'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx, page) => request(`api/list?page=${page}`, ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withRetry({ fallbackParams: [1] }))

// will call fetch(`api/list?page=1`)
fetchList.retry(ctx)
```

### Retry request on failure

`withRetry` accept optional `onReject` parameter which is a hook which is called with context, payload error and retries count parameters. This hook could return a number which will be used as a timer for scheduling `retry` action. To skip the retry scheduling return nothing or negative number.

Return `0` to retry immediately. With this pattern your loader will not blink, as `pendingAtom` will switch from `0` to `1` before subscribers notification.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withRetry } from '@reatom/async'

const fetchData = export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(
  withRetry({
    onReject(ctx, error, retries) {
      if (retries < 4) return 0
    },
  }),
)
```

### Retry request with exponential backoff

Progressive retry: `100 * Math.min(200, retries ** 3)`. Will retry after 100ms, 800ms, 2700ms, 6400ms, 1250ms, 20s, 20s and so on. To show a loader during retrying you can rely on `retriesAtom` with the number of retries.

```ts
import { atom, reatomAsync, withRetry } from '@reatom/async'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(
  withRetry({
    onReject: (ctx, error, retries) => 100 * Math.min(200, retries ** 3),
  }),
  withAssign((target, name) => ({
    loadingAtom: atom(
      (ctx) =>
        ctx.spy(target.pendingAtom) > 0 || ctx.spy(target.retriesAtom) > 0,
      `${name}.loadingAtom`,
    ),
  })),
)
```

Note that `retriesAtom` will drop to `0` when any promise resolves successfully or when you return `undefined` or a negative number. So, it is good practice to avoid calling multiple async actions in parallel. If you are using `withRetry`, it is recommended to always use it with [withAbort](#withabort) (with the default 'last-in-win' strategy).

```ts
import {
  atom,
  reatomAsync,
  withAbort,
  withErrorAtom,
  withRetry,
} from '@reatom/async'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(
  withAbort(),
  withRetry({
    onReject: (ctx, error, retries) => {
      // try to retry the request only 7 times
      if (retries < 7) {
        return 100 * Math.min(200, retries ** 3)
      }
      // otherwise do nothing - prevent retrying and show the error
    },
  }),
  withErrorAtom(),
)
export const isFetchListLoading = atom(
  (ctx) =>
    ctx.spy(fetchList.pendingAtom) > 0 || ctx.spy(fetchList.retriesAtom) > 0,
  'isFetchListLoading',
)
```

### Periodic refresh for used data

Do you need to implement a **pooling** pattern to stay your data fresh? Lets use `onConnect` from [@reatom/hooks](https://www.reatom.dev/package/hooks) to control the neediness of this.

```ts
import {
  reatomAsync,
  withDataAtom,
  withRetry,
  onConnect,
  sleep,
} from '@reatom/framework'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx, search: string) => request(`/api/list?q=${search}`, ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withDataAtom([]), withRetry())
onConnect(fetchList.dataAtom, async (ctx) => {
  while (ctx.isConnected()) {
    await fetchList.retry(ctx).catch(() => {})
    await ctx.schedule(() => sleep(5000))
  }
})
```

You could use `onConnect` automatic abort strategy to manage the neediness of the periodic refresh automatically! In other words, if you using `ctx.schedule` (which is highly recommended) you don't need `ctx.isConnected()`, as the schedule will throw abort automatically on disconnect.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withAbort, withDataAtom, withRetry, sleep } from '@reatom/framework' /* prettier-ignore */

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx, search: string) => request(`/api/list?q=${search}`, ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withAbort(), withDataAtom([]), withRetry())
onConnect(fetchList.dataAtom, async (ctx) => {
  while (true) {
    await fetchList.retry(ctx).catch(() => {})
    await ctx.schedule(() => sleep(5000))
  }
})
```

Here we rely on the fact that `onConnect` will be called only when `fetchList.dataAtom` is connected (subscribed) to the consumer and will be aborted when `fetchList.dataAtom` is disconnected (unsubscribed).

To be clear, you don't need to use `retry`, if you have no need to manage parameters.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withAbort, withDataAtom, sleep } from '@reatom/framework'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx) => request('/api/list', ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withAbort(), withDataAtom([]), withRetry())
onConnect(fetchList.dataAtom, async (ctx) => {
  while (true) {
    await fetchList(ctx).catch(() => {})
    await ctx.schedule(() => sleep(5000))
  }
})
```

## withAbort

This is the most powerful feature for advanced async flow management. It allows you to configure concurrency strategy of your effect. This operator allows you to use the full power of Reatom architecture by relies on a context causes and give the ability to handle concurrent requests like with [AsyncLocalStorage](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html) / AsyncContext ([Ecma TC39 proposal slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LLcZxYyuQ1DhBH1htvEFp95PkeYM5nLSrlQoOmWpYEI/edit#slide=id.p)) from a mature backend frameworks. Like redux-saga or rxjs it allows you to cancel concurrent requests of any depth, but unlike them, it does not require you to use generators, observables, or any additional abstraction! All needed information already stored in the context.

So, how does it work? By default, each effect in `reatomAsync` has its own `AbortController` in `ctx.controller`, but it isn't managed and doesn't do anything. To achieve the basic concurrency strategy of "last-in-win," you need to call `ctx.controller.abort()` for the previous effect when the new one is called, and to do it, you need to store the previous controller somewhere. We have an example code demonstrating this logic at the beginning of this page, check `abortControllerAtom` usage. However, performing this manually is annoying, so we have moved this logic to a reusable operator called `withAbort` and added a few additional methods:

- `abort` action: You can manually call this action to manage the abort logic yourself.
- `abortControllerAtom`: An atom that stores the `AbortController` of the last effect call.
- `onAbort` action: Used for handling abort from any cause. Please do not call it manually. It is useful to hook this action (`onAbort.onCall(doSome)`) for additional logic.

`withAbort` accepts an optional parameters object with a `strategy` property, which can be set to either `none`, `first-in-win`, or `last-in-win` (default).

Note that the behavior of your effect is influenced not only by the strategy and additional actions but also by the top-level cause controllers. For instance, `onConnect` also produces an `AbortController`. It will cancel your request when the associated atom is disconnected. However, it is possible that your request was called after connection with some additional parameters, and you still want to cancel it if the `dataAtom` becomes disconnected. You should describe this logic additionally. Please check the example below.

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withDataAtom, withAbort } from '@reatom/async'
import { onConnect } from '@reatom/hooks'

export const fetchList = reatomAsync(
  (ctx, page = 1) => request(`api/list?page=${page}`, ctx.controller),
  'fetchList',
).pipe(withDataAtom([]), withAbort())

onConnect(fetchList.dataAtom, (ctx) => {
  fetchList(ctx)
  // abort unneeded request
  return () => fetchList.abort(ctx)
})
```

In this case, the `fetchList` could be called with parameters, and each new request will cancel the previous one. Also, when the user leaves the page and the `dataAtom` becomes disconnected, the last request will be canceled too.

Check the real-world example in pooling example from [story tests below](https://www.reatom.dev/package/async#story-test) ([src](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/blob/v3/packages/async/src/index.story.test.ts)).

## reatomResource

This method is the simplest solution to describe an asynchronous resource that is based on local states. Let's delve into the problem.

For example, we need to display a list of items, and we have paging and a search field.

```ts
export const pageAtom = atom(1, 'pageAtom')
export const searchAtom = atom('', 'searchAtom')
```

We need to describe the fetching logic. How can we describe it using Reatom? The naive solution requires us to explicitly declare types. We also need to declare fetching triggers, which may not be obvious to the reader since it follows at the end of the code block. The problem with separate triggers is that if the dependent atoms update together (for example, on a reset button), there would be extra calls to fetching. So, to prevent race conditions in this case and for frequently used events, we need to use `withAbort`. Oh, and don't forget to include `onConnect` for initial loading!

```ts
import { reatomAsync, withDataAtom, withAbort } from '@reatom/async'
import { onConnect } from '@reatom/hooks'

const fetchList = reatomAsync(async (ctx, page: string, search: string) => {
  return await request(`/api/list?page=${page}&q=${search}`, ctx.controller)
}, 'fetchList').pipe(withDataAtom([]), withAbort())
onConnect(fetchList.dataAtom, (ctx) => {
  // init
  fetchList(ctx, ctx.get(pageAtom), ctx.get(searchAtom))
  // cleanup
  return () => fetchList.abort(ctx)
})
// trigger
pageAtom.onChange((ctx, page) =>
  fetchSuggestion(ctx, page, ctx.get(searchAtom)),
)
searchAtom.onChange((ctx, search) =>
  fetchSuggestion(ctx, ctx.get(pageAtom), search),
)
```

There are a lot of boilerplates. `reatomResource` is a fabric method that encapsulates all this logic and allows you to use `ctx.spy` just like in the regular `atom`. It is much simpler, more intuitive, and works automatically for both caching and cancelling previous requests.

```ts
import { reatomResource, withDataAtom } from '@reatom/async'

const listResource = reatomResource(async (ctx) => {
  const page = ctx.spy(pageAtom)
  const search = ctx.spy(searchAtom)
  return await ctx.schedule(() =>
    request(`/api/list?page=${page}&q=${search}`, ctx.controller),
  )
}, 'listResource').pipe(withDataAtom([]))
```

That's all. The code becomes much cleaner and simpler! The only additional change is the need for `ctx.schedule` for effects, as the callback in the `reatomResource` is called in the pure computations queue (to make `spy` work).

Also, `listResource` now has a `promiseAtom` that contains the last promise. You can use it with [useAtomPromise](https://www.reatom.dev/package/npm-react/#useatompromise) in a React application, for example.

If you need to set up a default value and use it synchronously, simply use `withDataAtom` as you would with any other async action. All async operators work fine with `reatomResource`. You could use `withRetry` and even `withCache`!

But that's not all! The most powerful feature of `reatomResource` is that you can use `promiseAtom` in another resources, which greatly simplifies dependent request descriptions and prevents complex race conditions, as the stale promises are always automatically canceled.

```ts
import { reatomResource } from '@reatom/async'

const aResource = reatomResource(async (ctx) => {
  const page = ctx.spy(pageAtom)
  return await ctx.schedule(() =>
    request(`/api/a?page=${page}`, ctx.controller),
  )
}, 'aResource')
const bResource = reatomResource(async (ctx) => {
  const a = await ctx.spy(aResource.promiseAtom)
  return await ctx.schedule(() => request(`/api/b/${b}`, ctx.controller))
}, 'bResource')
```

In this example, when the `pageAtom` updates, the entire chain of previous requests aborts, and all computed effects are called immediately.

Please note that `ctx.get` and `ctx.spy` of a `promiseAtom` return a promise, and you should `await` it to obtain the value.
